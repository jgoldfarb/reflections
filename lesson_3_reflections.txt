  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When there are different people contributing to the project - that way there is one set of 'everything' available to everyone that needs to see it.

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  For the same reasons that you would want manual control over your commits in your local machine - greater control over your commits, enabling you to group them by logical, proper context.
