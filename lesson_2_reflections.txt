What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a repository creates a hidden directory (.git) in order to store all of the relevant metadata and file versions.

  How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is where you temporarily place your files from your working directory before you commit them to the repository. Depending on the content and the logic of your files, you may want to commit them in different groupings or orders. The staging area helps you to arrange your commits logically.
